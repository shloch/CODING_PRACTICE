/*

There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. 
Try to find it!

findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

This is the first kata in series:

Find the unique number (this kata)
Find the unique string
Find The Unique

function findUniq(arr) {
  let myset = new Set(arr)
  let count = 0
  let arr2 = [...myset]
  for(let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    if(arr[i] == arr2[0]) {
      count++
    }
  }
  return (count == 1) ? arr2[0] : arr2[1]
}
