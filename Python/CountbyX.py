# Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first (n) multiples of (x).

# Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.

# Return the results as an array (or list in Python, Haskell or Elixir).

# Examples:

# count_by(1,10) #should return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
# count_by(2,5) #should return [2,4,6,8,10]

    for i in range(1,n+1):
